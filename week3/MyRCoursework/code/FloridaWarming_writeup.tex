        This paper uses a permutation analysis to demonstrate significant correlation between successive years in Key West, Florida.

    \section{Materials \& Methods}
	In order to determine whether there was a significant difference between temperatures were significantly correlated with temperatures in the next year, a Pearson's correlation test was used. However significance could not be calculated using a standard p-value from this correlation as time-points in a series are non-independent. 
	As a result a permutation analysis was used. Temperatures in successive years were randomly shuffled  
	
    
    \section{Results}
    Shuffled data correlations were found to range between -0.42 and 0.40, with a mean of 0. 
     Temperature and year were found to be positively correlated in our observed dataset, and this correlation was found to be highly significant; r(98) = 0.53, p = 0.00.
